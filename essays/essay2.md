Processes and threads represent two different approaches to virtualizing the CPU and providing
concurrent execution. Drawing upon our reading assignments, your experiences implementing the 
Unix shell project and the web server project, and concepts discussed in lecture, write an 
essay discussing the following:
1. What are the similarities and differences between how processes and threads virtualize the 
CPU and provide concurrency? Use specific examples from your implementations of the shell and 
the web server in support of your answer.
2. Describe two situations beyond those covered in our projects in which one would need 
concurrency. In one situation, argue as to why processes are preferable to threads as a 
concurrency mechanism. In the other situation, argue as to why threads are preferable to 
processes as a concurrency mechanism. Again, use specific examples from your implementations
of the shell and the web server to support your answer.
3. Write a concluding paragraph in which you summarize what you have learned about 
concurrency by this point in the course.
