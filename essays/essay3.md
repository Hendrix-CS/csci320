The operating system kernel is responsible for mediating all interactions with hardware.
The kernel employs the Three Easy Pieces to fulfill these responsibilities. Drawing upon our 
reading assignments, your experiences implementing bare-metal code in the last five course
projects, and concepts discussed in lecture, write an essay discussing the following:
1. Write an introduction in which you name the Three Easy Pieces, giving a 1-2 sentence 
summary of each.
2. For each piece, describe how it is employed in order to enable the kernel to fulfill its
task of mediating all interactions with hardware. Give specific examples from the bare-metal
programming assignments in support of your description. 
3. Write a concluding paragraph in which you summarize what you have learned about 
operating systems in general at this point in the course. Place particular emphasis on the
lessons you have learned from bare-metal programming.
