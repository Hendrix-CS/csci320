---

The Unix Shell allows the user to ask the operating system to start and stop 
processes (both sequentially and concurrently) and read and write files. In this
way, the Unix Shell enables the user to interact with all of what our
textbook refers to as the Three Easy Pieces of an operating system.

Drawing upon our reading assignments, your experiences implementing the first 
four projects, and concepts discussed in lecture, write an essay describing the
following:
1. Write an introduction in which you name the Three Easy Pieces, giving a 1-2 sentence 
summary of each.
2. For each piece, describe about how it is addressed by the Unix shell. Give specific
examples from your implementations of the first four course projects in support of
your description.
3. Write a concluding paragraph in which you summarize what you have learned about 
operating systems in general at this point in the course.
