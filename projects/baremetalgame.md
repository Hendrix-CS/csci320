Classic early video games such as [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), 
[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), and
[Pac-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) were implemented without an operating system.
The games mediated all hardware interaction by themselves.

In this project, you will use the [Pluggable Interrupt OS](https://crates.io/crates/pluggable_interrupt_os)
to develop a bare-metal video game. The graphical aspect of the game will be rendered in the VGA buffer.
You are encouraged to be creative in using VGA characters to represent your game graphics.

You are welcome to develop an original game or to create your own interpretation of a classic game.
As an example, feel free to reference [Ghost Hunter](https://github.com/gjf2a/ghost_hunter),
my own interpretation of a well-known classic.

Unlike our other projects, for this project you are welcome to work in a team of up to three students.

## Interrupts

The primary purpose of this project is for you to gain experience writing software that handles
[hardware interrupts](https://os.phil-opp.com/hardware-interrupts/). When an event pertinent to the hardware
occurs, it notifies the CPU by signaling an interrupt. The CPU responds to the interrupt by suspending execution
of whatever code it is running and running the code designated for handling the interrupt. Naturally, 
interrupt-handling code should complete as quickly as possible so that the CPU can resume normal execution.


## Setup

The [Pluggable Interrupt OS](https://crates.io/crates/pluggable_interrupt_os) provides a convenient framework for
specifying to the CPU the code to be executed to handle each interrupt. 

I have created a [template](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template) 
for you to use as a starting point for your projects. To start your project, clone 
the [Pluggable Interrupt Template](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template) 
project. In order to build the project, you'll also need to install:
* [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)
* Nightly Rust:
  * `rustup override set nightly`
* `llvm-tools-preview`:
  * `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`
* The [bootimage](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage) tool:
  * `cargo install bootimage`
* On Windows:
  * `rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  
Once the template is up and running, you will be ready to implement your own interrupt handlers! Of course,
you'll want to change the project name and authors in 
[Cargo.toml](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template/blob/master/Cargo.toml), and you'll also 
want to set up your own GitHub repository for it.

The template project demonstrates a simple interactive program that uses both keyboard and timer interrupts.
When the user types a viewable key, it is added to a string in the middle of the screen.
When the user types an arrow key, the string begins moving in the indicated direction.
Here is its [`main.rs`](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template/blob/master/src/main.rs):

```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use pc_keyboard::DecodedKey;
use pluggable_interrupt_os::HandlerTable;
use pluggable_interrupt_os::vga_buffer::clear_screen;
use pluggable_interrupt_template::LetterMover;
use crossbeam::atomic::AtomicCell;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    HandlerTable::new()
        .keyboard(key)
        .timer(tick)
        .startup(startup)
        .cpu_loop(cpu_loop)
        .start()
}

static LAST_KEY: AtomicCell<Option<DecodedKey>> = AtomicCell::new(None);
static TICKS: AtomicCell<usize> = AtomicCell::new(0);

fn cpu_loop() -> ! {
    let mut kernel = LetterMover::new();
    let mut last_tick = 0;
    loop {
        if let Some(key) = LAST_KEY.load() {
            LAST_KEY.store(None);
            kernel.key(key);
        }
        let current_tick = TICKS.load();
        if current_tick > last_tick {
            last_tick = current_tick;
            kernel.tick();
        }
    }
}

fn tick() {
    TICKS.fetch_add(1);
}

fn key(key: DecodedKey) {
    LAST_KEY.store(Some(key));
}

fn startup() {
    clear_screen();
}
```

The **_start()** function kicks everything off by placing references to our interrupt handling functions
in a **HandlerTable** object. Invoking **.start()** on the **HandlerTable**
sets up the interrupt handlers, then starts execution of the `cpu_loop()` function.

I created the [`LetterMover`](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template/blob/master/src/lib.rs)
`struct` to represent the application state. It is maintained inside of 
`cpu_loop()`. It gets updated in response to messages from the interrupt
handlers. Those messages are sent by updating shared `AtomicCell` objects.

Whenever a timer interrupt occurs, `tick()` increases `TICKS` by one. Whenever a
keyboard interrupt occurs, `key()` updates `LAST_KEY` to contain the most
recent keypress.

The `cpu_loop()` checks `TICKS` constantly. Whenever a new tick occurs,
it instructs the `LetterMover` to update its state accordingly. Similarly, 
whenever a new keypress appears, `cpu_loop()` relays that keystroke
to `LetterMover`. 

This shows the basic design that all of these projects should employ:
* Create a `main.rs` that sets up the interrupt handlers.
* Write a `cpu_loop()` function that contains the main data structures
  and monitors concurrent state for updates from interrupts.
* Write one-line handlers for the timer and keyboard that reference shared
  state that `cpu_loop()` can employ.
* Place all of the game functionality within the game-state object, defined in **lib.rs**.


Here is the rest of its code, found in its [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_template/blob/master/src/lib.rs) file:
```
#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]

use bare_metal_modulo::{ModNumC, MNum, ModNumIterator};
use pluggable_interrupt_os::vga_buffer::{BUFFER_WIDTH, BUFFER_HEIGHT, plot, ColorCode, Color, is_drawable};
use pc_keyboard::{DecodedKey, KeyCode};
use num::traits::SaturatingAdd;

#[derive(Copy,Debug,Clone,Eq,PartialEq)]
pub struct LetterMover {
    letters: [char; BUFFER_WIDTH],
    num_letters: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_WIDTH>,
    next_letter: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_WIDTH>,
    col: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_WIDTH>,
    row: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_HEIGHT>,
    dx: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_WIDTH>,
    dy: ModNumC<usize, BUFFER_HEIGHT>
}

impl LetterMover {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        LetterMover {
            letters: ['A'; BUFFER_WIDTH],
            num_letters: ModNumC::new(1),
            next_letter: ModNumC::new(1),
            col: ModNumC::new(BUFFER_WIDTH / 2),
            row: ModNumC::new(BUFFER_HEIGHT / 2),
            dx: ModNumC::new(0),
            dy: ModNumC::new(0)
        }
    }

    fn letter_columns(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item=usize> {
        ModNumIterator::new(self.col)
            .take(self.num_letters.a())
            .map(|m| m.a())
    }

    pub fn tick(&mut self) {
        self.clear_current();
        self.update_location();
        self.draw_current();
    }

    fn clear_current(&self) {
        for x in self.letter_columns() {
            plot(' ', x, self.row.a(), ColorCode::new(Color::Black, Color::Black));
        }
    }

    fn update_location(&mut self) {
        self.col += self.dx;
        self.row += self.dy;
    }

    fn draw_current(&self) {
        for (i, x) in self.letter_columns().enumerate() {
            plot(self.letters[i], x, self.row.a(), ColorCode::new(Color::Cyan, Color::Black));
        }
    }

    pub fn key(&mut self, key: DecodedKey) {
        match key {
            DecodedKey::RawKey(code) => self.handle_raw(code),
            DecodedKey::Unicode(c) => self.handle_unicode(c)
        }
    }

    fn handle_raw(&mut self, key: KeyCode) {
        match key {
            KeyCode::ArrowLeft => {
                self.dx -= 1;
            }
            KeyCode::ArrowRight => {
                self.dx += 1;
            }
            KeyCode::ArrowUp => {
                self.dy -= 1;
            }
            KeyCode::ArrowDown => {
                self.dy += 1;
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }

    fn handle_unicode(&mut self, key: char) {
        if is_drawable(key) {
            self.letters[self.next_letter.a()] = key;
            self.next_letter += 1;
            self.num_letters = self.num_letters.saturating_add(&ModNumC::new(1));
        }
    }
}
```

The keyboard handler receives each character as it is typed. Keys representable as a `char`
are added to the moving string. The arrow keys change how the string is moving.
